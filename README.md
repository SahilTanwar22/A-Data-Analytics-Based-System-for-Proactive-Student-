# 📊 A Data Analytics-Based System for Proactive Student Performance Monitoring and Personalized Learning Interventions
End-to-End Classification with Random Forest, XGBoost, SHAP, and Visualizations

This project provides a clean, reproducible machine-learning pipeline for analyzing an activity-tracking dataset, performing preprocessing, building predictive models, interpreting feature importance, and evaluating performance using modern ML tools.

The workflow is implemented in a Jupyter/Colab notebook (Untitled15.ipynb) and includes all steps from data ingestion to model interpretation.
